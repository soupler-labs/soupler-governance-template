## Purpose

Every governed document and source file declares ownership and licence consistently.

## 1 · Documents

The `Copyright` header field is always `© <current year> @@org.copyright@@. All rights reserved.` and `License` defaults to `@@org.license@@`. The year is the year of creation and is not rewritten on edits.

## 2 · Source files

New source files in first-party packages carry a one-line header comment:

```
// © @@year@@ @@org.copyright@@. All rights reserved.
```

Generated files, vendored code and third-party snippets keep their original notices and are never relabelled.

## 3 · Third-party material

Anything under a licence (fonts, icons, music, stock media) is recorded with its licence and permitted use before it ships.
