## Purpose

Which repositories make up @@org.name@@, what each owns, and which direction truth flows. This is the document behind every "never modify a sibling from here" rule in the repos' `CLAUDE.md` files.

<!-- gov:begin topology -->
@@#each repos as r@@
- **`@@r.name@@`** — profile `@@r.profile@@`@@#if r.description@@: @@r.description@@@@/if@@
@@/each@@
<!-- gov:end topology -->

Standards (L0) live in **`@@standardsRepo@@`**.

## Rules

1. One repository owns each fact; others follow. Following never edits the owner.
2. Locally the repos are siblings under one parent directory (`../<repo>`); tooling and docs refer to siblings by that relative path.
3. A change that spans repos is made in the owner first, then in each follower, as separate PRs in their own repositories.
4. Cross-origin calls between a client repo and an API repo require the API's allowed-origins list to be updated in the same change.
