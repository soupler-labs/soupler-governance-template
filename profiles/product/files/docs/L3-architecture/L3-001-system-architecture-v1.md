## Purpose

The map of @@repo.name@@: components, boundaries, data ownership and the ADRs that justify them. Update this whenever a boundary or diagram stops being true (L0-006 §3.3).

## 1 · Components and boundaries

⚠️ GAP: list each app/service/package, what it owns, what it may call, and what it must not touch.

| Component | Owns | Calls | Must not touch |
|---|---|---|---|
| TODO | | | |

## 2 · Data ownership

⚠️ GAP: which component owns which tables/topics; cross-component access goes through contracts only.

## 3 · Architecture Decision Records

An ADR is required when a change alters *how the system works*, not merely that it works. Add each as a numbered section below (never renumber), or as its own `L3-NNN-adr-slug-v1` document once it outgrows a section.

### ADR-001 — TODO title
- **Status**: Proposed | Accepted | Superseded by ADR-NNN
- **Context**: what forced the decision
- **Decision**: what we chose
- **Consequences**: what gets easier, what gets harder, what we now must enforce (and how)
