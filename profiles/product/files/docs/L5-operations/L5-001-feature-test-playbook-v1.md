## Purpose

How every shipped feature — and the current integrated slice — is verified, by a human or CI. Update it whenever shipped functionality, setup or verification steps change.

## 1 · Section template (one per feature)

### Feature: TODO
- **Prerequisites**: services running, seed data, accounts
- **Steps**: numbered, executable
- **Expected results**: observable outcome per step (UI state, response body, DB row, log line)
- **Error paths**: empty results, wrong status, missing data, boundary values
- **Automated checks**: the test files/commands that cover it
- **Known local limitations**: what this playbook cannot prove, and where that is verified instead

## 2 · Features
⚠️ GAP: add a section per shipped feature.
